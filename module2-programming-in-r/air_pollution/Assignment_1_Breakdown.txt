The Mental Model You’re Missing (this is the key 🔑)

Think of this assignment as having three layers:

🧠 Layer 1 — The DATA (CSV files)

You download specdata.zip

You unzip it

Inside is a folder called specdata/

Inside that are 332 CSV files:

001.csv
002.csv
...
332.csv

Each CSV has columns:

Date

sulfate

nitrate

📌 These are NOT Excel files, even if they open in Excel.
They are CSV text files, and R reads them directly.

🧠 Layer 2 — Your FUNCTION (the R script)

When you write something like:

pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)

Here’s what R does:

Looks in the working directory

Finds the folder named "specdata"

Opens files 001.csv through 010.csv

Pulls the sulfate column

Ignores NA

Computes the mean

Returns one number

⚠️ Nothing happens magically
R only reads data when you run the function

🧠 Layer 3 — The QUIZ

The quiz is not interactive with your computer.

Instead, it assumes:

“If the student wrote the function correctly and ran it on the real data, this would be the answer.”

So you must run the function locally to know the answer.



Where the CSV files come in (this is the part Coursera never explains)

Inside your function, this line:

read.csv(filepath)

…is what opens the CSV files.

Because:

directory = "specdata"

filename = "001.csv" (etc.)

file.path(directory, filename) becomes:

specdata/001.csv

R automatically:

Opens the file

Reads it into a data frame

Makes the columns available (sulfate, nitrate)

You never manually open the CSVs.
They are inputs, not something you touch.

Why writing the .R scripts matters

Two reasons:

1️⃣ For you

The quiz answers depend on your function being correct.

2️⃣ For grading

Coursera will later run something like:

source("pollutantmean.R")
pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:332)

If your function works → you pass.




Why guessing feels impossible (and why that’s normal)

You were subconsciously thinking:

“Am I supposed to reason this out?”

Nope.
This is not a math quiz.

It’s a “does your code work?” quiz.
