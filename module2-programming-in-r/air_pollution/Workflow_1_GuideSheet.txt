How This All Fits Together (Concrete Workflow)
Step 1 — Put things in the right place

Your folder should look like this:

📁 air_pollution/
├── specdata/
│   ├── 001.csv
│   ├── 002.csv
│   └── ...
├── pollutantmean.R
├── complete.R
└── corr.R


📌 The folder name must be exactly specdata

Step 2 — Write the function (once)

Example: pollutantmean.R

Save it.

Step 3 — Load the function into R

In the Console:

setwd("path/to/air_pollution")
source("pollutantmean.R")

Now R knows the function.

Step 4 — Run the EXACT quiz calls

When the quiz asks:

pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)

You literally run:

pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)

R prints a number like:

[1] 4.064

🎯 That’s the answer you choose in the quiz.




About the complete() quiz question (important)

When the quiz shows:

cc <- complete("specdata", c(6, 10, 20, 34, 100, 200, 310))
print(cc$nobs)

You do this in R:

source("complete.R")
cc <- complete("specdata", c(6, 10, 20, 34, 100, 200, 310))
cc$nobs

R will output something like:

[1] 227 184 189 196 232 224 189

🎯 That exact sequence is the quiz answer.




Now, here’s the missing glue (the exact workflow)
Step 1: Open RStudio

You do everything from RStudio, not Coursera.

Step 2: Set your working directory (once per session)

In the Console:

setwd("C:/Simulation_Projects/GitHub/R/air_pollution")

Then verify:

getwd()

It should print:

C:/Simulation_Projects/GitHub/R/air_pollution

This is why "specdata" works — R is now standing in that folder.

Step 3: Load your function

For example, for quiz questions about pollutantmean():

source("pollutantmean.R")

This does not run the function — it just teaches R that the function exists.

Step 4: Answer quiz questions by running them verbatim

When the quiz asks:

pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)

You run that exact line in the console:

pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)

R returns something like:

[1] 4.064

➡️ You select 4.064 in the quiz.

That’s it. No interpretation. No guessing.



✅ Complete workflow comprehension

Your console shows you now understand all of this as one system:

Data → Function → Source → Call → Output → Quiz

Not separate steps.
One pipeline.
