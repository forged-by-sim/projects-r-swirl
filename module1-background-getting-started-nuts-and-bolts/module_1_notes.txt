R Console Input and Evaluation notes

x <- 1 means x is assigned by 1

[1] 1 

[1] means first element of the vector

x <- 5

x 

[1] 5 

The [1] indicates that x is a vector and 5 is the first element. 

msg <- "hello" means msg is assigned by "hello" 

1:20 means creating a sequence of integers from 1 to 20 (inclusive).

[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 

[16] 16 17 18 19 20

: is a colon operator, which creates a sequence of integers (inclusive). 



Data Types - R Objects and Attributes notes

R has five basic or "atomic" classes of objects:
-character
-numeric (real numbers)
-integer
-complex
-logical (true/false)

The most basic object is a vector:
-A vector can only contain  objects of the same class
-BUT: The one exception is a list, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes 

Empty vectors can be created with the vector() function

Numbers

-Numbers in R a generally treated as numeric objects (I.e. double precision real numbers) 
-If you explicitly want an integer, you need to specify the L suffix
-There is also a special number Inf which represents infinity
-The value NaN represents an undefined value ("not a number") 

Attributes 

R objects can have attributes 
-names, dimnames
-dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
-class
-length
-other user-defined attributes/metadata

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the attributes() function. 



Data Types - Vectors and Lists 

Creating Vectors 
-The c() function can be used to create vectors of objects. 
-Using the vector() function

Mixing Objects 
-When different objects are mixed in a vector, coercion occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class.

Explicit Coercion
-Objects can be explicitly coerced from one class to another using the as.* functions, if available. 
-Nonsensical coercion results in NAS. 

Lists 
-Lists are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes. Lists are a very important data type in R and you should get to know them well.



Data Types - Matrices

-Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2 (nrow, ncol)
-Matrices are constructed column-wise, so entries can be thought of starting in the "upper left" corner and running down the columns.
-Matrices can also be created directly from vectors by adding a dimension attribute.

cbind-ing and rbind-ing
-Matrices can be created by column-binding or row-binding with cbind() and rbind(). 



Data Types - Factors 

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be unordered or ordered. One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label. 
-Factors are treated specially by modelling functions like lm() and glm()
-Using factors with labels is better than using integers because factors are self-describing; having a variable that has values "Males" and "Females" is better than a variable that has values 1 and 2. 

-The order of the levels can be set using the levels argument to factor(). This can be important in linear modelling because the first level is used as the baseline level. 



Data Types - Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN for undefined mathematical operations.
-is.na() is used to test objects if they are NA
-is.nan() is used to test for NaN
-NA values have a class also, so there are integer NA, character NA, etc.
-A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true 



Data Types - Data Frames 

Data frames are used to store tabular data
-They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length
-Each element of the list can be thought of asna column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows
-Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (just like this); matrices must have every element be the same class
-Data frames also have a special attribute called row.names
-Data frames are usually created by calling read.table() or read.csv()
-Can be converted to a matrix by calling data.matrix()



Data Types - Names Attribute

-R objects can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects. 
-Lists can also have names. 
-Matrices have names.



Reading Tabular Data 

There are a few principal functions reading data into R.
-read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data
-readLines, for reading lines of a text file
-source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump) 
-dhet, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
-load, for reading in saved workspaces
-unserialize, for reading single R objects in binary form

Writing Data
There are analogous functions for writing data to files
-write.table
-writeLines
-dump
-dput
-save
-serialize

Reading Data Files with read.table
The read.table function is one of the most commonly used functions for reading data. It has a few important arguments:
-file, the name of a file, or a connection
-header, logical indicating if the file has a header line
-sep, a string indicating how the columns are separated 
-colClasses, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
-nrows, the number of rows in the dataset
-comment.char, a character string indicating the comment character
-skip, the number of lines to skip from the beginning
-stringAsFactors, should character variables be coded as factors?

read.table
For small to moderately sized datasets, Yoh can usually call read.table without specifying any other arguments
data <- read.table('foo.txt')

R will automatically
-skip lines that begin with a # 
-figure out how many rows there are (and how much memory needs to be allocated)
-figure what type of variable is in each column of the table Telling R all those things directly makes R run faster and more efficiently
-read.csv is identical to read.table except that the default separator is a comma



Reading Larger Tables

Reading in Larger Datasets with read.table
With much larger datasets, doing the following things will make your life easier and will prevent R from choking.
-Read the help page for read.table, which contains many hints
-Make a rough calculation of the memory required to store your dataset. if the dataset is larger than the amount of RAM on your computer, you can probably stop right here.
-Set comment.char = "" if there are no commented lines in your file. 
-Use the colClasses argument. Specifying this option instead of using the default can make 'read.table' run MUCH faster, often twice as fast. In order to use this option, you have to know the class of each column in your data frame. If all of the columns are 'numeric', for example, then you can just set colClasses = "numeric". A quick and dirty way to figure out the classes of each column is the following:
initial <- read.table("debatable.txt", crows = 100)
classes <- supply(initial, class)
tabAll <- read.table("dabatable.txt",
                    colClasses = classes)
-Set nrows. This doesn't make R run faster but it helps with memory usage. A mild overestimate is okay. You can use the Unix tool wc to calculate the number of lines in a file. 

Know Thy System
In general, when using R with larger datasets, it's useful to know a few things about your system.
-How much memory is available?
-What other applications are in use?
-Are there other users logged into the same system?
-What operating system?
-Is the OS 32 or 64 bit? 

Calculating Memory Requirements 
I have a data frame with 1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, all of which are numeric data. Roughly, how much memory is required to store this data frame?
1,500,000 x 120 x 8 bytes/numeric
=1440000000 bytes
=1440000000 / 2^20 bytes/MB
=1,373.29 MB
=1.34 GB



Textual Data Formats

Textual Formats
-dumping and dputing are useful because the resulting textual format is edit-able, and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable
-Unlike writing out a table pr csv file, dump and dput preserve the metadata (sacrificing some readability), so that another user doesn't have to specify it all over again.
-textual formats can work much better with version control programs like subversion or git which can only track changes meaningfully in text files
-Textual formats can be longer-lived; if there is corruption somewhere in the file, it can be easier to fix the problem
-Textual formats adhere to the "Unix philosophy"
-Downside: The format is not very space-efficient

dputing R Objects
Another way to pass data around is by deparsing the R object with dput and reading it back in using dget.

Dumping R Objects
Multiple objects can be deparsed using the dump function and read back in using the source. 



Connections: Interfaces to the Outside World

Interfaces to the Outside World 
Data are read in using connection interfaces. Connections can be made to files (most common) or to other more exotic things.
-file, opens a connection to a file
-gzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with gzip
-bzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with bzip2
-url, opens a connection to a webpage 

File Connections 
-description is the name of the file
-open is a code indicating
-"r" read only
-"w" writing (and initializing a new file)
-"a" appending
-"rb", "wb", "ab" reading, writing, or appealing in binary mode (Windows) 

Connections
In general, connections are powerful tools that let you navigate files or other external objects. In practice, we often don't need to deal with the connection interface directly. 

Reading Lines of a Text File
writeLines takes a character vector and writes each element one line at a time to a text file. 
readLines can be useful for reading in lines of webpages




Subsetting - Basics 

There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects.
- [ always returns an object of the same class as the original; can be used to select more than one element (there is one exception) 
- [[ is used to extract elements of a list or a data frame; it can only be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame 
- $ is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of [[





Subsetting - Lists 
The [[ operator can be used with computed indices; $ can only be used with literal names. 

Subsetting Nested Elements of a List
The [[ can take an integer sequence.





Subsetting - Matrices
Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with (i,j) type indices.
Indices can also be missing. 
By default, when a single element of a matrix is retrieved, it is returned as a vector of length 1 rather than a 1 x 1 matrix. This behavior can be turned off by setting drop = FALSE.
Similarly, subsetting a single column or a single row will give you a vector, not a matrix (by default). 





Subsetting - Partial Matching 
Partial matching of names is allowed with [[ and $





Subsetting - Removing Missing Values
A common task is to remove missing values (NAS) 
What if there are multiple things and you want to take the subset with no missing values? 





Vectorized Operations 
Many operations in R are vectorized making code more efficient, concise, and easier to read.
