## 🧭 About This Repository  
This repository documents my applied journey through *Advanced R Programming*, where I moved beyond syntax into modular, functional, and object-oriented design. Instead of just completing swirl prompts, I created controlled experiments, rewrote broken components, and built standalone projects that demonstrate core logic and debugging in action.

Each module folder includes:
- ✅ Swirl lessons with `.R` scripts, screenshots, and notes  
- ✅ Independent experiments + test scripts  
- ✅ Functional, object-oriented, and performance-based mini projects  
- ✅ Clean folder structure + custom README notes (where relevant)

## 🧠 Modules Overview

| Folder | Module Theme                  | Project or Focus                                |

| `m1-intro-advanced-r`         | Environments, closures, lexical scoping       | Controlled scope experiments                     |
| `m2-functions-core`          | Function factories, argument matching         | Binary operations, input validation              |
| `m3-functions-extended`      | Variadic arguments, `...`, return logic       | String chaining and condition-based evaluation   |
| `m4-functional-programming`  | Mapping, walking, reducing with `purrr`       | Custom mad libs generator                        |
| `m5-functional-advanced`     | Swirl failure: `reduce_right()` workaround    | Manual function replication + case log           |
| `m6-debugging-and-profiling` | Debugging tools, timing functions             | Profiling factorial speed with `Rprof()`         |
| `m7-object-oriented-programming` | S3, S4, RC object systems                   | Factorial calculator across all 3 paradigms      |

Each folder contains original `.R` scripts, debug notes, and screenshots of logic validation or swirl testing. Broken swirl cases are documented with timestamps and Coursera sandbox workarounds.

## 🧰 Key Skills Practiced

- ✅ Writing pure and impure R functions with return control  
- ✅ Creating and chaining functions through closures and environments  
- ✅ Functional programming using `map()`, `walk()`, `reduce()`  
- ✅ Debugging with `traceback()`, `browser()`, and RStudio tools  
- ✅ Profiling performance with `system.time()` and `Rprof()`  
- ✅ Object-oriented design using S3, S4, and RC (Reference Classes)

## ✍️ Reflection  
This advanced track taught me to **think modularly**, **debug strategically**, and **build reusable logic** under simulation-like conditions. I stopped viewing R as a scripting language and started using it as a **simulation engine** — complete with condition trees, profiling diagnostics, and interchangeable object systems.

From rewriting swirl’s broken logic to structuring output visualizations for performance testing, every step brought me closer to real-world simulation thinking.  
This repo marks the leap from procedural coding to simulation-ready development in R.
