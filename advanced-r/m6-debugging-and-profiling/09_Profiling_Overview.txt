Some of the R code that you write will be slow. Slow code often isn’t worth fixing in a script that you will only evaluate a few times, as the time it will take to optimize the code will probably exceed the time it takes the computer to run it. However, if you are writing functions that will be used repeatedly, it is often worthwhile to identify slow sections of the code so you can try to improve speed in those sections.

In this section, we will introduce the basics of profiling R code, using functions from two packages, microbenchmark and profvis. Theprofvis package is fairly new and requires recent versions of both R (version 3.0 or higher) and RStudio. If you are having problems running either package, you should try updating both R and RStudio (the Preview version of RStudio, which will provide full functionality forprofvis, is available for download
