From the traceback output, it is often possible to determine in which function and on which line of code an error occurs. If you are the author of the code in question, one easy thing to do is to insert a call to the browser() function in the vicinity of the error (ideally, before the error occurs). The browser()function takes now arguments and is just placed wherever you want in the function. Once it is called, you will be in the browser environment, which is much like the regular R workspace environment except that you are inside a function.


check_n_value <- function(n) {
        if(n > 0) {
                browser()  ## Error occurs around here
                stop("n should be <= 0")
        }
}


Now, when we call error_if_n_is_greater_than_zero(5), we will see the following.


error_if_n_is_greater_than_zero(5)
Called from: check_n_value(n)
