Debugging is the process of getting your expectations to converge with reality. When writing software in any language, we develop a certain set of expectations about how the software should behave and what it should do. But inevitably, when we run the software, it does something different from what we expected. In these situations, we need to engage in a process to determine if

Our expectations were incorrect, based on the documented behavior of the software; or

There is a problem with the code, such that the programming is not done in a way that will match expectations.

This is the process of debugging.

In the previous section, we discussed what to do when software generates conditions (errors, warnings, messages) in a manner that is completely expected. In those cases, we know that certain functions will generate errors and we want to handle them in a manner that is not the usual way.

This section describes the tools for debugging your software in R. R comes with a set of built-in tools for interactive debugging that can be useful for tracking down the source of problems. These functions are

browser(): an interactive debugging environment that allows you to step through code one expression at a time

debug() / debugonce(): a function that initiates the browser within a function

trace(): this function allows you to temporarily insert pieces of code into other functions to modify their behavior

recover(): a function for navigating the function call stack after a function has thrown an error

traceback(): prints out the function call stack after an error occurs; does nothing if there’s no error
