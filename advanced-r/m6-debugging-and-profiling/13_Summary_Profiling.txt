Summary

Profiling can help you identify bottlenecks in R code.

The microbenchmark package helps you profile short pieces of code and compare functions with each other. It runs the code many times and provides summary statistics across the iterations.

The profvis package allows you to visualize performance across more extensive code. It can be used to profile code within functions being developed for a package, as long as the package source code has been loaded locally using devtools::load_all.
