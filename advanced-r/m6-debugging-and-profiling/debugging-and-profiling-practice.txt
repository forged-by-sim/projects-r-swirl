==> getting your expectations about code behavior to converge with reality


2. Which of the following functions initiates an interactive debugging environment that allows you to step through code one expression at a time?
==> browser()


3. Which of the following functions allows you to temporarily insert pieces of code into other functions to modify their behavior?
==> trace()


4. What does the traceback() function do?
==> returns the state of the function cal stack just before an occurred


5. When should the traceback() function be called?
==> immediately after an error occurs 


6. What does calling trace("f") for function "f()" do?
==> Whenever f() is called, a message is printed to the console indicating that the function was called.


7. What is the microbenchmark package useful for?
==> comparing the speed of several functions that do the same thing 


8. What does the RProf() function do?
==> writes out the function call stack at user-specified intervals of time


9. What does the profvis() function do?
==> displays profiling information in an interactive visualization in RStudio


10. Which function is better for analyzing fast-running functions: profvis() or microbenchmark()?
==> profvis()
