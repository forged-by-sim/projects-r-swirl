### 📌 Issue Summary

### 🧪 Environment Details
- Platform: Coursera

2. Attempted browser-level fixes:
   - Cleared cache and cookies
   - Disabled browser extensions
   - Tried multiple browsers

### 🧭 Workaround Implemented
To continue progress:
- Repeated the Swirl lesson using the **Coursera-hosted Sandbox RStudio IDE**
- Successfully submitted token through alternate environment
- Received full credit via workaround

---

### ✅ Outcome
Although the issue was not resolved through Coursera Support, a manual workaround using the Sandbox IDE allowed the assignment to be completed and full progress in the course to resume.

### 💬 Notes
This issue highlights a potential mismatch between Swirl lesson environments (local vs. Coursera IDE).  
The lack of technical resolution from support prompted public documentation for other learners facing the same bug.
