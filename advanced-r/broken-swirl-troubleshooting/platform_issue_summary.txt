# 🛠️ Coursera Platform Issues – Advanced R Programming

This folder (`broken-coursera-swirl/`) documents platform-side grading and submission issues encountered during the **Advanced R Programming** course on Coursera (Johns Hopkins University). The issues primarily involved **Swirl lessons** failing to register properly, even after full completion, resulting in blocked course progress or rejected token submissions.

All issues were documented with case numbers, screenshots, support interactions, and forum posts.

## 🧭 Timeline of Workaround
- Swirl assignments completed in **R 4.5.2 + RStudio** for most modules
- Final swirl assignment completed using the **Coursera-hosted RStudio Sandbox** due to token submission failure
- Manual workaround allowed full course objectives to be completed
- Course remains listed at 96% (no certificate issued as of last update)
