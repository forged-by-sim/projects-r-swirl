# 🧪 Swirl Troubleshooting Logs  
**Folder**: `broken-swirl-troubleshooting`  
**Purpose**: Documenting swirl submission issues and platform bugs during Advanced R Programming coursework

⸻

## 🔍 About This Folder  
During the *Advanced R Programming* course, I encountered several platform-related bugs that prevented proper submission of swirl lessons. Rather than abandon the work, I took initiative to:

- Open and track multiple support cases with Coursera  
- Troubleshoot submission errors via RStudio and Coursera Sandbox  
- Document each issue with redacted screenshots, forum replies, and status logs  
- Assist peers by updating public forum threads with workarounds and PSA updates

## ✅ Why This Matters  
These logs demonstrate my ability to:
- Troubleshoot under pressure  
- Communicate clearly with support and peers  
- Maintain documentation for future learners and platforms  
- Finish what I start — even when the platform breaks  

This is more than just coursework. It’s a record of resilience and technical problem-solving.
