The group of functions that includes keep(), discard(),every(), and some() are known as filter functions. Each of these functions takes a vector and a predicate function. For keep() only the elements of the vector that satisfy the predicate function are returned while all other elements are removed:


keep(1:20, function(x){
  x %% 2 == 0
})
 [1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20


The discard() function works similarly, it only returns elements that don’t satisfy the predicate function:


discard(1:20, function(x){
  x %% 2 == 0
})
 [1]  1  3  5  7  9 11 13 15 17 19


The every() function returns TRUE only if every element in the vector satisfies the predicate function, while the some() function returns TRUE if at least one element in the vector satisfies the predicate function:


every(1:20, function(x){
  x %% 2 == 0
})

some(1:20, function(x){
  x %% 2 == 0
})
