There are a few essential functions for generating errors, warnings, and messages in R. The stop() function will generate an error. Let's generate an error:


stop("Something erroneous has occured!")


Error: Something erroneous has occured!


If an error occurs inside of a function then the name of that function will appear in the error message:


name_of_function <- function(){
  stop("Something bad happened.")
}

name_of_function()
Error in name_of_function(): Something bad happened.


The stopifnot() function takes a series of logical expressions as arguments and if any of them are false an error is generated specifying which expression is false. Let's take a look at an example:


error_if_n_is_greater_than_zero <- function(n){
  stopifnot(n <= 0)
  n
}

error_if_n_is_greater_than_zero(5)
Error: n <= 0 is not TRUE


The warning() function creates a warning, and the function itself is very similar to the stop() function. Remember that a warning does not stop the execution of a program (unlike an error.)


warning("Consider yourself warned!")
Warning: Consider yourself warned!


Just like errors, a warning generated inside of a function will include the name of the function it was generated in:


make_NA <- function(x){
  warning("Generating an NA.")
  NA
}

make_NA("Sodium")
Warning in make_NA("Sodium"): Generating an NA.
[1] NA


Messages are simpler than errors or warnings, they just print strings to the R console. You can issue a message with themessage() function:


message("In a bottle.")
In a bottle.
