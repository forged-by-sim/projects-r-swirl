There are groups of functions that are essential for functional programming. In most cases they take a function and a data structure as arguments, and that function is applied to that data structure in some way. The purrr library contains many of these functions and we’ll be using it throughout this section. Function programming is concerned mostly with lists and vectors. I may refer to just lists or vectors, but you should know that what applies for lists generally applies for vectors and vice-versa.
