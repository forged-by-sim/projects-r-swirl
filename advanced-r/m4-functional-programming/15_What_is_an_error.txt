Errors most often occur when code is used in a way that it is not intended to be used. For example adding two strings together produces the following error:


"hello" + "world"
Error in "hello" + "world": non-numeric argument to binary operator


The + operator is essentially a function that takes two numbers as arguments and finds their sum. Since neither "hello"nor "world" are numbers, the R interpreter produces an error. Errors will stop the execution of your program, and they will (hopefully) print an error message to the R console.

In R there are two other constructs in R which are both related to errors: warnings and messages. Warnings are meant to indicate that something seems to have gone wrong in your program which should be inspected. Here's a simple example of a warning being generated:


as.numeric(c("5", "6", "seven"))
Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
[1]  5  6 NA


The as.numeric() function attempts to convert each string in c("5", "6", "seven") into a number, however it is impossible to convert "seven", so a warning is generated. Execution of the code is not halted, and an NA is produced in place of "seven" instead of a number.

Messages simply print test to the R console, though they are generated by an underlying mechanism that is similar to how errors and warning are generated. Here's a small function that will generate a message:


f <- function(){
  message("This is a message.")
}

f()
This is a message.
