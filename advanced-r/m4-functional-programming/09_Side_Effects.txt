Side effects of functions occur whenever a function interacts with the “outside world” – reading or writing data, printing to the console, and displaying a graph are all side effects. The results of side effects are one of the main motivations for writing code in the first place! Side effects can be tricky to handle though, since the order in which functions with side effects are executed often matters and there are variables that are external to the program (the relative location of some data). If you want to evaluate a function across a data structure you should use the walk() function from purrr. Here’s a simple example:


library(purrr)

walk(c("Friends, Romans, countrymen,",
       "lend me your ears;",
       "I come to bury Caesar,", 
       "not to praise him."), message)
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar,
not to praise him.
