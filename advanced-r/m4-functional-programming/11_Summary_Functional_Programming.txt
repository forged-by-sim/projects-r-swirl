Summary

Functional programming is based on lambda calculus.

This approach concentrates on data, variables, functions, and function applications.

It’s possible for functions to be able to return other functions.

The core functional programming concepts can be summarized in the following categories: map, reduce, search, filter, and compose.

Partial application of functions allows functions to be used like data structures.

Side effects are difficult to debug although they motivate a huge fraction of computer programming.

The most important part of understanding recursion is understanding recursion.
