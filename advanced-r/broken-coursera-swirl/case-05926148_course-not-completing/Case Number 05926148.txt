Case Number: 05926148  
Date Opened: January 14, 2026  
Status: Closed / unresolved  
Course status: 96% complete despite full graded component completion (93.33% average)

---

### 📌 Issue Summary
Although all graded components for the **Advanced R Programming** course were successfully completed — including quizzes and a peer-reviewed assignment — the course remained stuck at 96% due to Swirl lessons not being marked as complete.

Mentor confirmation from another Johns Hopkins-affiliated course stated that **Swirl completions no longer impact certificates**, yet the system continued to block certificate issuance.

### 🧪 Environment Details
- Platform: Coursera
- Course: Advanced R Programming (Johns Hopkins)
- Completion: All assignments, quizzes, and peer-reviewed components passed
- Remaining: Only Swirl exercises unmarked, despite not counting toward final grade

---

### 🛠️ Actions Taken
1. Submitted support ticket requesting manual course completion or certificate eligibility based on graded components alone
2. Attached screenshots showing:
   - Course progress stuck at 96%
   - Forum post link and timestamp
   - Mentor confirmation from related course
3. Coursera Support requested proof of Community Forum post
4. Shared forum link and all requested images in follow-up email

---

### 📥 Coursera Response
Despite the evidence and escalations:
- Support confirmed no mentors are currently assigned to the course
- Response loop redirected issue back to the Community Forum
- Final response re-sent general instructions for posting, despite confirmation the post had already been made

### ⚠️ Remaining Issue
This appears to be a **platform-side logic bug**:
> Swirl assignments are no longer required, yet still block course completion.

Escalation request to supervisor or backend engineer was made, but no resolution was reached by the support team.

---

### ✅ Manual Workaround (previously done for prior case)
Used Coursera Sandbox IDE to re-do Swirl submissions for earlier modules.  
No solution available for retroactively forcing course to register 100% without backend action.

### 💬 Notes
This case reflects a **gap between policy updates and platform logic**, highlighting how legacy grading components (Swirl) can still impact course progression despite no longer being tied to certificates. Documented here for transparency and as a caution for future learners.
