# 🔁 M3 – Extended Practice: R Functions

**Folder**: `m3-functions-extended`  
**Origin**: Deep dive into [Lesson 9 – Functions] from the R Programming Swirl course  
**Focus**: Custom scripts, test cases, and screenshots to reinforce reusable function design

⸻

## 🧠 Purpose  
This folder expands on Lesson 9 by practicing function writing, nesting, and error handling. The goal was to internalize function mechanics by writing my own variants and studying output closely via screenshots and custom inputs.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `01_functions.png` through `09_functions.png` – Visual output of function design, nesting, and edge cases  
- `R/scripts_functions/` – Manually written `.R` scripts replicating and extending swirl-style function design  
- `README.md` – Summary of approach and reasoning

⸻

## 💡 Key Concepts Practiced

- Defining functions with and without return values
- Parameter handling and scope
- Chaining and nesting functions
- Manual testing with varied inputs
- Output visualization

## 📂 Additional Scripts

Located in the `R scripts_functions/` subfolder:

| File Name                     | Description                            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `bin_op_advanced_R.R`        | Function handling binary operations     |
| `boring_function_advanced_R.R` | Simple string-returning function       |
| `evaluate_advanced_R.R`      | Function evaluating conditional logic   |
| `mad_libs_advanced_R.R`      | Function generating a custom sentence   |
| `my_mean_advanced_R.R`       | Manual calculation of mean              |
| `remainder_advanced_R.R`     | Modulo operation function               |
| `telegram_advanced_R.R`      | Function transforming string formatting |

## 🪞 Reflection  
This was my turning point for understanding how functions can be modularized for reuse and tested in isolation. Instead of passively completing swirl prompts, I created my own controlled experiments. The repetition across 9 screenshots and multiple R script tests helped cement function structure, return logic, and scoping in a real-world context.
