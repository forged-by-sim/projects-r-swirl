# 🔀 M5 – Functional Programming (Advanced)
**Folder**: `m5-functional-advanced`  
**Focus**: Deepening understanding of functional programming using real-world code patterns, repetition, and resilience through error troubleshooting

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module built upon previous function-writing lessons by introducing **functional programming concepts** such as `map`, `reduce`, and function chaining using `purrr`. It became a personal deep-dive into applied logic, structure, and repeatability in R—culminating in hands-on tests of RStudio's capabilities versus Coursera’s sandbox.

## 🗂️ Structure  
**Screenshots**  
- `01_` through `11_` – Captures of completed swirl exercises, both local and sandbox-based

**Script Files**  
- `functional_programming.R` – All swirl answers replicated and annotated in RStudio  
- `archive_m5/reduce_right.R` – Local RStudio testing of `reduce_right()` prior to confirmed Coursera issue  
- `archive_m5/functional_programming_reference.pdf` – Downloaded resource from swirl course for context

**README**  
- `README_professional_summary_advanced_R_m5.txt` – Summary of workflow and troubleshooting highlights

⸻

## 🔑 Key Concepts Practiced

- Introduction to **higher-order functions** (`map`, `reduce`, etc.)
- Breaking down **functional chains** into manageable parts
- Replication of swirl logic in local `.R` files to reinforce learning
- Exposure to **sandbox limitations vs local R 4.5.2 environment**
- Repeated function transformations for **muscle memory**

⸻

## 🧪 Notable Challenges

- ⚠️ `reduce_right()` failed locally in R 4.5.2 due to **deprecated behavior**
  - Documented in `reduce_right.R` script
  - Final completion achieved via Coursera's **cloud-based Sandbox**
- Maintained a dual-environment approach to confirm reproducibility

⸻

## 💡 Reflection

This was the **pivot point** where swirl-style repetition transformed into genuine applied understanding. By translating every prompt into standalone `.R` files and pushing through the `reduce_right()` roadblock, I developed more confidence debugging issues in real time. The process felt less like “following instructions” and more like **reverse-engineering puzzle logic**—the kind often encountered in technical interviews or simulation script planning.
