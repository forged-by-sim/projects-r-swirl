# 🧠 M1 – Welcome to Advanced R  
**Folder**: `m1-intro-advanced-r`  
**Focus**: Revisiting foundational logic through a deeper lens—tracing environments, exploring evaluation, and preparing for functional programming.
**Tools Used**: R 4.5.2, RStudio, Swirl, Sandbox

⸻

## 🎯 Overview  
This module kicked off the transition from basic scripting to a deeper understanding of how R behaves under the hood. I re-examined variable assignment, scope, and the evaluation model—key for understanding environments, closures, and debugging later.

⸻

## 🛠️ Core Skills Practiced

- Navigating R’s **evaluation model** (`<-`, `=`, `<<-`)  
- Tracing variable creation and function scope  
- Understanding how **environments and symbols** interact  
- Distinguishing **expression** vs **evaluation** in RStudio  
- Identifying differences between `environment()`, `parent.env()`, and global/local environments  

⸻

## 📎 Notes

This module set the groundwork for functional programming, especially how R builds and evaluates expressions. I began to think in terms of **how code is parsed**, not just what it outputs—a mindset that paid off in Modules 2–4.
