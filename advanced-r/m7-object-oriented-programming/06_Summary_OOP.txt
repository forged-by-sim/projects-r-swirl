Summary

R has three object oriented systems: S3, S4, and Reference Classes.

Reference Classes are the most similar to classes and objects in other programming languages.

Classes are blueprints for an object.

Objects are individual instances of a class.

Methods are functions that are associated with a particular class.

Constructors are methods that create objects.

Everything in R is an object.

S3 is a liberal object oriented system that allows you to assign a class to any object.

S4 is a more strict object oriented system that build upon ideas in S3.

Reference Classes are a modern object oriented system that is similar to Java, C++, Python, or Ruby.
