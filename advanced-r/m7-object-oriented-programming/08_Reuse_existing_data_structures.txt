R has a number of data structures (data frames, vectors, etc.) that people have grown accustomed to over the many years of R’s existence. While it is often tempting to develop custom data structures, for example, by using S3 or S4 classes, it is often worthwhile to consider reusing a commonly used structure. You’ll notice that many tidyverse functions make heavy use of the data frame (typically as their first argument), because the data frame is a well-known, well-understood structure used by many analysts. Data frames have a well-known and reasonably standardized corresponding file format in the CSV file.

While common data structures like the data frame may not be perfectly suited to your needs as you develop your own software, it is worth considering using them anyway because the enormous value to the community that is already familiar with them. If the user community feels familiar with the data structures required by your code, they are likely to adopt them more quickly.
