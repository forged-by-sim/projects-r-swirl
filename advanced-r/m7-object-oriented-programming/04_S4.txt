The S4 system is slightly more restrictive than S3, but it’s similar in many ways. To create a new class in S4 you need to use thesetClass() function. You need to specify two or three arguments for this function: Class which is the name of the class as a string,slots, which is a named list of attributes for the class with the class of those attributes specified, and optionally contains which includes the super-class of they class you’re specifying (if there is a super-class). Take look at the class definition for a bus_S4 and aparty_bus_S4 below:


setClass("bus_S4",
         slots = list(n_seats = "numeric", 
                      top_speed = "numeric",
                      current_speed = "numeric",
                      brand = "character"))
setClass("party_bus_S4",
         slots = list(n_subwoofers = "numeric",
                      smoke_machine_on = "logical"),
         contains = "bus_S4")


Now that we’ve created the bus_S4 and the party_bus_S4 classes we can create bus objects using the new() function. The new()function’s arguments are the name of the class and values for each “slot” in our S4 object.

12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637
my_bus <- new("bus_S4", n_seats = 20, top_speed = 80, 
              current_speed = 0, brand = "Volvo")
my_bus
An object of class "bus_S4"
Slot "n_seats":
[1] 20

Slot "top_speed":
[1] 80

Slot "current_speed":
[1] 0

Slot "brand":
[1] "Volvo"
my_party_bus <- new("party_bus_S4", n_seats = 10, top_speed = 100,
                    current_speed = 0, brand = "Mercedes-Benz", 
                    n_subwoofers = 2, smoke_machine_on = FALSE)
my_party_bus
An object of class "party_bus_S4"
Slot "n_subwoofers":
[1] 2

Slot "smoke_machine_on":
[1] FALSE

Slot "n_seats":
[1] 10

Slot "top_speed":
[1] 100

Slot "current_speed":
[1] 0

Slot "brand":
[1] "Mercedes-Benz"



You can use the @ operator to access the slots of an S4 object:

1234
my_bus@n_seats
[1] 20
my_party_bus@top_speed
[1] 100


This is essentially the same as using the $ operator with a list or an environment.

S4 classes use a generic method system that is similar to S3 classes. In order to implement a new generic method you need to use thesetGeneric() function and the standardGeneric() function in the following way:


setGeneric("new_generic", function(x){
  standardGeneric("new_generic")
})


Let’s create a generic function called is_bus_moving() to see if a bus_S4 object is in motion:


setGeneric("is_bus_moving", function(x){
  standardGeneric("is_bus_moving")
})
[1] "is_bus_moving"


Now we need to actually define the function which we can to withsetMethod(). The setMethod() functions takes as arguments the name of the method as a string, the method signature which specifies the class of each argument for the method, and then the function definition of the method:


setMethod("is_bus_moving",
          c(x = "bus_S4"),
          function(x){
            x@current_speed > 0
          })
[1] "is_bus_moving"

is_bus_moving(my_bus)
[1] FALSE
my_bus@current_speed <- 1
is_bus_moving(my_bus)
[1] TRUE


In addition to creating your own generic methods, you can also create a method for your new class from an existing generic. First use thesetGeneric() function with the name of the existing method you want to use with your class, and then use the setMethod() function like in the previous example. Let’s make a print() method for the bus_S4 class:


setGeneric("print")
[1] "print"

setMethod("print",
          c(x = "bus_S4"),
          function(x){
            paste("This", x@brand, "bus is traveling at a speed of", x@current_speed)
          })
[1] "print"

print(my_bus)
[1] "This Volvo bus is traveling at a speed of 1"
print(my_party_bus)
[1] "This Mercedes-Benz bus is traveling at a speed of 0"
