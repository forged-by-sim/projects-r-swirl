This can be a tough principle for people coming from other non-functional programming languages. But the reality is, R is a functional programming language (with its roots in Scheme) and it’s best not to go against the grain. In our section on Functional Programming, we outlined many of the principles that are fundamental to functional-style programming. In particular, the purrr package implements many of those ideas.

One benefit to functional programming is that it can at times be easier to reason about when simply looking at the code. The inability to modify arguments enables us to predict what the output of a function will be given a certain input, allowing for things like memoization. Functional programming also allows for simple parallelization, so that we can quickly parallelize any code that uses lapply() or map().
