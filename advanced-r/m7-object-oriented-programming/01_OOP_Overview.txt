Object oriented programming is one of the most successful and widespread philosophies of programming and is a cornerstone of many programming languages including Java, Ruby, Python, and C++. R has three object oriented systems because the roots of R date back to 1976, when the idea of object oriented programming was barely four years old. New object oriented paradigms were added to R as they were invented, so some of the ideas in R about object oriented programming have gone stale in the years since. It’s still important to understand these older systems since a huge amount of R code is written with them, and they’re still useful and interesting! Long time object oriented programmers reading this book may find these old ideas refreshing.

The two older object oriented systems in R are called S3 and S4, and the modern system is called RC which stands for “reference classes.” Programmers who are already familiar with object oriented programming will feel at home using RC.
