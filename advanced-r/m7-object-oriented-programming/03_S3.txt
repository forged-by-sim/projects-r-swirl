Conveniently everything in R is an object. By “everything” I mean every single “thing” in R including numbers, functions, strings, data frames, lists, etc. If you want to know the class of an object in R you can simply use the class() function:


class(2)
[1] "numeric"
class("is in session.")
[1] "character"
class(class)
[1] "function"


Now it’s time to wade into some of the quirks of R’s object oriented systems. In the S3 system you can arbitrarily assign a class to any object, which goes against most of what we discussed in the Object Oriented Principles section. Class assignments can be made using thestructure() function, or you can assign the class using class()and <-:


special_num_1 <- structure(1, class = "special_number")
class(special_num_1)
[1] "special_number"

special_num_2 <- 2
class(special_num_2)
[1] "numeric"
class(special_num_2) <- "special_number"
class(special_num_2)
[1] "special_number"


This is completely legal R code, but if you want to have a better behaved S3 class you should create a constructor which returns an S3 object. The shape_S3() function below is a constructor that returns a shape_S3 object:


shape_s3 <- function(side_lengths){
  structure(list(side_lengths = side_lengths), class = "shape_S3")
}

square_4 <- shape_s3(c(4, 4, 4, 4))
class(square_4)
[1] "shape_S3"

triangle_3 <- shape_s3(c(3, 3, 3))
class(triangle_3)
[1] "shape_S3"



We’ve now made two shape_S3 objects: square_4 and triangle_3, which are both instantiations of the shape_S3 class. Imagine that you wanted to create a method that would return TRUE if a shape_S3 object was a square, FALSE if a shape_S3 object was not a square, and NA if the object provided as an argument to the method was not a shape_s3 object. This can be achieved using R’s generic methods system. A generic method can return different values based depending on the class of its input. For examplemean() is a generic method that can find the average of a vector of number or it can find the “average day” from a vector of dates. The following snippet demonstrates this behavior:


mean(c(2, 3, 7))
[1] 4
mean(c(as.Date("2016-09-01"), as.Date("2016-09-03")))
[1] "2016-09-02"


Now let’s create a generic method for identifying shape_S3 objects that are squares. The creation of every generic method uses theUseMethod() function in the following way with only slight variations:


[name of method] <- function(x) UseMethod("[name of method]")


Let’s call this method is_square:


is_square <- function(x) UseMethod("is_square")


Now we can add the actual function definition for detecting whether or not a shape is a square by specifying is_square.shape_S3. By putting a dot (.) and then the name of the class after is_squre, we can create a method that associates is_squre with the shape_S3class:


is_square.shape_S3 <- function(x){
  length(x$side_lengths) == 4 &&
    x$side_lengths[1] == x$side_lengths[2] &&
    x$side_lengths[2] == x$side_lengths[3] &&
    x$side_lengths[3] == x$side_lengths[4]
}

is_square(square_4)
[1] TRUE
is_square(triangle_3)


Seems to be working well! We also want is_square() to return NAwhen its argument is not a shape_S3. We can specifyis_square.default as a last resort if there is not method associated with the object passed to is_square().


is_square.default <- function(x){
  NA
}

is_square("square")
[1] NA
is_square(c(1, 1, 1, 1))
[1] NA


Let’s try printing square_4:


print(square_4)
$side_lengths
[1] 4 4 4 4

attr(,"class")
[1] "shape_S3"


Doesn’t that look ugly? Lucky for us print() is a generic method, so we can specify a print method for the shape_S3 class:


print.shape_S3 <- function(x){
  if(length(x$side_lengths) == 3){
    paste("A triangle with side lengths of", x$side_lengths[1], 
          x$side_lengths[2], "and", x$side_lengths[3])
  } else if(length(x$side_lengths) == 4) {
    if(is_square(x)){
      paste("A square with four sides of length", x$side_lengths[1])
    } else {
      paste("A quadrilateral with side lengths of", x$side_lengths[1],
            x$side_lengths[2], x$side_lengths[3], "and", x$side_lengths[4])
    }
  } else {
    paste(
      "A shape with", length(x$side_lengths), "sides." )
  }
}

print(square_4)
[1] "A square with four sides of length 4"
print(triangle_3)
[1] "A triangle with side lengths of 3 3 and 3"
print(shape_s3(c(10, 10, 20, 20, 15)))
[1] "A shape with 5 sides."
print(shape_s3(c(2, 3, 4, 5)))
[1] "A quadrilateral with side lengths of 2 3 4 and 5"



Since printing an object to the console is one of the most common things to do in R, nearly every class has an assocaited print method! To see all of the methods associated with a generic like print() use the methods() function:


head(methods(print), 10)
 [1] "print,ANY-method"            "print,diagonalMatrix-method"
 [3] "print,sparseMatrix-method"   "print.acf"                  
 [5] "print.AES"                   "print.anova"                
 [7] "print.anova.gam"             "print.anova.lme"            
 [9] "print.aov"                   "print.aovlist"        


      
One last note on S3 with regard to inheritance. In the previous section we discussed how a sub-class can inherit attributes and methods from a super-class. Since you can assign any class to an object in S3, you can specify a super class for an object the same way you would specify a class for an object:


class(square_4)
[1] "shape_S3"
class(square_4) <- c("shape_S3", "square")
class(square_4)
[1] "shape_S3" "square"  


To check if an object is a sub-class of a specified class you can use the inherits() function:


inherits(square_4, "square")
[1] TRUE
