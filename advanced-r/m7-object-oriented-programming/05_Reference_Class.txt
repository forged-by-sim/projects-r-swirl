With reference classes we leave the world of R’s old object oriented systems and enter the philosophies of other prominent object oriented programming languages. We can use the setRefClass() function to define a class’ fields, methods, and super-classes. Let’s make a reference class that represents a student:


Student <- setRefClass("Student",
                      fields = list(name = "character",
                                    grad_year = "numeric",
                                    credits = "numeric",
                                    id = "character",
                                    courses = "list"),
                      methods = list(
                        hello = function(){
                          paste("Hi! My name is", name)
                        },
                        add_credits = function(n){
                          credits <<- credits + n
                        },
                        get_email = function(){
                          paste0(id, "@jhu.edu")
                        }
                      ))


To recap: we’ve created a class definition called Student which defines the student class. This class has five fields and three methods. To create a Student object use the new() method:

1234
brooke <- Student$new(name = "Brooke", grad_year = 2019, credits = 40,
                    id = "ba123", courses = list("Ecology", "Calculus III"))
roger <- Student$new(name = "Roger", grad_year = 2020, credits = 10,
                    id = "rp456", courses = list("Puppetry", "Elementary Algebra"))


You can access the fields and methods of each object using the $operator:


brooke$credits
[1] 40
roger$hello()
[1] "Hi! My name is Roger"
roger$get_email()
[1] "rp456@jhu.edu"


Methods can change the state of an object, for instance in the case of the add_credits() function:


brooke$credits
[1] 40
brooke$add_credits(4)
brooke$credits
[1] 44


Notice that the add_credits() method uses the complex assignment operator (<<-). You need to use this operator if you want to modify one of the fields of an object with a method. You’ll learn more about this operator in the Expressions & Environments section.

Reference classes can inherit from other classes by specifying the contains argument when they’re defined. Let’s create a sub-class of Student called Grad_Student which includes a few extra features:


Grad_Student <- setRefClass("Grad_Student",
                            contains = "Student",
                            fields = list(thesis_topic = "character"),
                            methods = list(
                              defend = function(){
                                paste0(thesis_topic, ". QED.")
                              }
                            ))

jeff <- Grad_Student$new(name = "Jeff", grad_year = 2021, credits = 8,
                    id = "jl55", courses = list("Fitbit Repair", 
                                                "Advanced Base Graphics"),
                    thesis_topic = "Batch Effects")

jeff$defend()
[1] "Batch Effects. QED."
