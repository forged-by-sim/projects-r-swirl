Making your code readable and usable by people is goal that is overlooked surprisingly often. The result is things like function names that are obscure and do not actually communicate what they do. When writing code, using things like good, explicit, function names, with descriptive arguments, can allow for users to quickly learn your API. If you have a set of functions with a similar purpose, they might share a prefix (see e.g. geom_point(),geom_line(), etc.). If you have an argument like color that could either take arguments1, 2, and 3, or black, red, and green, think about which set of arguments might be easier for humans to handle.
