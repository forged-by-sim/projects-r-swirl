# 🧠 OOP Project – Functional Object-Oriented Programming in R

📁 Folder: `oop-project`  

⸻

## 🎯 Objective

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in R using `S3`, `S4`, and `Reference Class` systems. It includes two original programs built in R:

- A factorial calculator
- An object-oriented implementation of custom behavior

The goal was to explore how data and behavior can be encapsulated together in R’s multiple OOP systems while integrating functional programming techniques such as piped composition and reuse of data structures.

## 🧪 Key Concepts Applied

- ✅ Built and compared `S3`, `S4`, and `Reference Class` objects  
- ✅ Used functional composition (`%>%`) with reusable functions  
- ✅ Simulated real-world behavior by assigning attributes and methods  
- ✅ Validated results via text output and sample I/O testing

## ✍️ Reflection

This project was a turning point — object-oriented programming in R felt clunky at first, but writing the same logic across three different paradigms deepened my understanding of **flexible code design**. I came away with more confidence about using **functional OOP** patterns when needed, and knowing when to stick with base R simplicity.
