for loops can be nested inside of each other.

x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)

for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
        for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
                print(x[i, j])
        }   
}


Nested loops are commonly needed for multidimensional or hierarchical data structures (e.g. matrices, lists). Be careful with nesting though. Nesting beyond 2 to 3 levels often makes it difficult to read or understand the code. If you find yourself in need of a large number of nested loops, you may want to break up the loops by using functions (discussed later).
