The if-else combination is probably the most commonly used control structure in R (or perhaps any language). This structure allows you to test a condition and act on it depending on whether it's true or false.

For starters, you can just use the if statement.

if(<condition>) {
      ## do something
}
      ## Continue with rest of code


The above code does nothing if the condition is false. If you have an action you want to execute when the condition is false, then you need an else clause.

if(<condition>) {
      ## do something
}
else {
      ## do something else
}


You can have a series of tests by following the initial if with any number of else ifs.

if(<condition1>) {
      ## do something
} else if(<condition2>) {
      ## do something different
} else {
      ## do something different
}


Here is an example of a valid if/else structure.

## Generate a uniform random number
x <- runif(1, 0, 10)
if(x > 3) {
        y <- 10
} else {
        y <- 0
}


The value of y is set depending on whether x > 3 or not.

Of course, the else clause is not necessary. You could have a series of if clauses that always get executed if their respective conditions are true.

if(<condition1>) {
}
if(<condition2>) {
}
