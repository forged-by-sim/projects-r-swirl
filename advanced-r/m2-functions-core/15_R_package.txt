R packages are collections of functions that together allow one to conduct a series of related operations. We will not go into detail about R packages here, but we bring them up only to indicate that they are the natural evolution of writing many functions. R packages similarly have an interface or API which specifies to the user what functions he/she can call in their own code. The development and maintenance of R packages is the major focus of the next chapter.
