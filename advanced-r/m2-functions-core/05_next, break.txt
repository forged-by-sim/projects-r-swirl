next is used to skip an iteration of a loop.

for(i in 1:100) {
        if(i <= 20) {
                ## Skip the first 20 iterations
                next                 
        }
        ## Do something here
}


break is used to exit a loop immediately, regardless of what iteration the loop may be on.

for(i in 1:100) {
      print(i)

      if(i > 20) {
              ## Stop loop after 20 iterations
              break  
      }     
}
