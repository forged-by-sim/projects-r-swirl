# Caching Matrix Inverse – Pointer Repo

This folder documents my work for **Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping** in the *R Programming* course (Johns Hopkins University, Coursera).

> ✅ The **official graded code** lives in a separate repository:  
> [`ProgrammingAssignment2` on GitHub](https://github.com/forged-by-sim/ProgrammingAssignment2)

## How This Folder Relates to `ProgrammingAssignment2`

- Serves as a **local hub** inside the `course-r-swirl` repo, keeping Module 3 notes and artifacts close to the swirl lessons and quizzes.
- Contains **supporting materials** (notes, screenshots, and any test scripts) that explain how the caching mechanism works and how I approached the assignment.
- Points directly to the full implementation of `makeCacheMatrix()` and `cacheSolve()` in the `ProgrammingAssignment2` repo, which is the version used for grading.
- Demonstrates how I separate **course-wide documentation** (`course-r-swirl`) from a **focused, forked assignment repo** (`ProgrammingAssignment2`) while keeping the two clearly linked.
