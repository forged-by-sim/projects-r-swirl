## 🧭 About This Repository  
This repository contains my hands-on journey through R programming fundamentals. I used the interactive `swirl` package to master core concepts, then applied them to independent projects that involved simulation, healthcare analytics, matrix caching, and environmental data cleaning.

Each module folder includes:
- ✅ Swirl lessons with `.R` scripts, screenshots, and notes  
- ✅ Weekly practice exercises  
- ✅ One real-world capstone project per module  
- ✅ Clean folder structure + portfolio-style READMEs

## 🧠 Modules Overview

| Folder | Module Theme                        | Capstone Project                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `m1-intro-nuts-and-bolts`  | Syntax, data types, subsetting       | *(Practice-focused)*            |
| `m2-core-programming`      | Logic, functions, dates              | `air-pollution-project`         |
| `m3-loop-functions-and-debugging` | Loops, closures, caching          | `caching-matrix-inverse-project`|
| `m4-simulation-and-profiling`     | Simulation, performance profiling | `hospital-quality-project`      |

Each project folder features original `.R` functions, input datasets, test results, and reflection notes. Screenshots demonstrate validation and performance testing.

## 🧰 Key Skills Practiced

- ✅ Writing vectorized code in base R  
- ✅ Debugging with `traceback()`, `debug()`, and `browser()`  
- ✅ Profiling and optimizing performance with `Rprof()` and `system.time()`  
- ✅ File I/O operations and structured scripting  
- ✅ Simulating random datasets and creating data visualizations  
- ✅ Encapsulation using closures and lexical scoping

## ✍️ Reflection  
This repo documents my progression from R novice to capable scriptwriter. I now understand how to:
- Think in vectors
- Build robust functions
- Simulate real-world conditions
- Analyze and visualize structured data

This foundational work prepared me for more advanced R tasks, including statistical modeling, tidyverse workflows, and domain-specific projects in simulation and data science.
