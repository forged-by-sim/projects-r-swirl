## 🎯 Objective  
To build two R functions that cache the inverse of a matrix, using lexical scoping and closures. This helps avoid redundant computation and demonstrates how to manage state within functional logic.

⸻

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Lexical scoping and environments  
- Creating closures with persistent local variables  
- Efficient caching with `<<-` assignment  
- Debugging, tracing, and performance awareness

📎 Why This Folder Exists

This folder serves as a “pointer repo” and local workspace linked to the official graded repo. It was created to:

Keep course-wide context and documentation close to the original swirl modules

Store supporting files like notes, screenshots, and .txt drafts

Separate graded submission (ProgrammingAssignment2) from my learning process

Preserve traceability while showing I can scope and separate repos cleanly

💡 Real-World Takeaway

Caching logic like this is foundational in simulation environments, where rerunning complex matrix operations can be costly. This exercise mirrors performance‑minded coding—ideal for resource-constrained systems and modeling pipelines.

✍️ Reflection

This was one of my favorite challenges in the R Programming course. I moved beyond syntax and truly engaged with how R stores and retrieves data in memory. It helped me develop a deeper appreciation for functional thinking and reusable logic.
