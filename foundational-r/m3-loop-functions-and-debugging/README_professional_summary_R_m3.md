Each folder contains:
- 🧪 `.R` scripts demonstrating applied control logic  
- 🖼️ Annotated screenshots walking through code output  
- 🧠 Reflections on function design and debugging steps  
- 🧾 Case study for matrix caching logic (Project folder)

This module marks a major shift: from *running R code* to *designing R behavior*. The caching project especially showed how powerful closures and scoping can be when managing memory and performance in real-world scenarios.
