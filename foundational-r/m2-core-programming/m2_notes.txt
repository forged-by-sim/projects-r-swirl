Control Structures

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program, depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are
- if, else: testing a condition
- for: execute a loop a fixed number of times 
- while: execute a loop while a condition is true 
- repeat: execute an infinite loop
- break: break the execution of a loop
- next: skip an interation of a loop
- return: exit a function 
Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when using writing functions or longer expressions. 




Control Structures - For Loops

For Loops take and interator variable and assign it successive values from a sequence or vector. For loops are most commonly used for iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc.)

Nested for loops
Be careful with nesting, though. Nesting beyond 2-3 levels is often very difficult to read/understand.




Control Structures - While Loops

While Loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, then they execute the loop body. Once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth.
While loops can potentially result in infinite loops if not written properly. Use with care! 
Sometimes there will be more than one condition in the test.
Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.





Control Structures - Repeat, Next, Break 

Repeat initiates an infinite loop; these are not commonly used in statistical applications but they do have their uses. The only way to exit a repeat loop is to call break. 

Next, Return
Next is used to skip an iteration of a loop
Return signals that a function should exit and return a given value 

Summary
-Control structures like if, while, and for allow you to control the flow of an R program
-Infinite loops should generally be avoided, even if they are theoretically correct.
-Control structures mentioned here are primarily useful for writing programs; for command-line interactive work, the *apply functions are more useful





Functions (part 1)

Functions are created using the function() directive and are sorted as R objects just like anything else. In particular, they are R objects of class "function".
Functions in R are "first class objects", which means that they can be treated much like any other R object. Importantly,
-Functions cam be passed as arguments to other functions
-Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function inside of another function. The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated. 

Function Arguments 
Functions have named arguments which potentially have default values.
-The formal arguments are the arguments included in the function definition
-The formals function returns a list of all the formal arguments of a function 
-Not every function cal in R makes use of all the formal arguments 
-Function arguments can be missing or might have default values

Argument Matching 
R functions arguments can be matched positionally or by name. So the following calls to SD are all equivalent
Even though it's legal, I don't recommend messing around with the order of the arguments too much, since it can lead to some confusion.
You can mix positional matching with matching by name. When an argument is matched by name, it is "taken out" of the argument list and the remaining unnamed arguments are matched in the order that they are listed in the function definition. 
Most of the time, named arguments are useful on the command line when you have a long argument list and you want to use the default for everything except for an argument near the end of the list
Named arguments also help if you can remember the name of the argument and not its position on the argument list (plotting is a good example). 
Function arguments can also be partially matched, which is useful for interactive work. The order of operations when given an argument is 
1. Check for exact match for a named argument 
2. Check for a partial match
3. Check for a positional match




Functions (part 2)

Defining a Function
In addition to not specifying a default value, you can also set an argument value to NULL. 

Lazy Evaluation
Arguments to functions are evaluated lazily, so they are evaluated only as needed.
This function never actually uses the argument b, so called f(2) will not produce an error because the 2 gets positionally matched to a. 

The "..." Argument 
The ... argument indicate a variable number of arguments that are usually passed on to other functions.
- ... is often used when extending another function and you don't want to copy the entire argument list of the original function
-Generic functions use ... so that extra arguments can be passed to methods (more on this later). 
The ... argument is also necessary when the number of arguments passed to the function cannot be known in advance. 

Arguments Coming After the "..." Argument
One catch with ... is that any arguments that appear after ... on the argument list must be named explicitly and cannot be partially matched. 






Scoping Rules - Symbol Binding 

A Diversion on Binding Values to Symbol
When R tries to bind a value to as symbol, it searches through a series of environments to find the appropriate value. When you are working on the command line and need to retrieve the value of an R object, the order is roughly
1. Search the global environment for a symbol name matching the one requested.
2. Search the namespaces of each of the packages on the search list.
The search list can be found by using the search function. 

Binding Values to Symbol
-The global environment or the user's workspace is always the first element of the search list and the base package is always the last.
-The order of the packages on the search list matters!
-User's can configure which packages get loaded on startup so you cannot assume that there will be a set list of packages available. 
-When a user loads a package with library the namespace of the package gets put in position 2 of the search list (by default) and everything else gets shifted down the list.
-Note that R has separate namespaces for functions and non-functions so it's possible to have an object named c and a function named c. 

Scoping Rules
The scoping rules for R are the main feature that make it different from the original S language.
-The scoping rules determine how a value is associated with free variable in a function.
-R uses lexical scoping or static scoping. A common alternative is dynamic scoping. 
-Related to the scoping rules is how R uses the search list to bind a value to a symbol.
-Lexical scoping turns out to be particularly useful for simplifying statistical computations. 

Lexical Scoping 
Lexical Scoping in R means that 
the values of the free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined.
What is an environment?
-An environment is a collection of (symbol, value) pairs, i.e. x is a symbol and 3.14 might be its value.
-Every environment has a present environment; it is possible for an environment to have multiple "children"
-the only environment without a parent is the empty environment 
-A function + an environment = a closure or function closure 

Searching for the value for a free variable:
-If the value of a symbol is not bound in the environment in which a function was defined, then the search is continued in the parent environment
-The search continues down the sequence of parent environment until we hit the top-level environment; this usually the global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package.
-After the top-level environment, the search continues down the search list until we hit the empty environment. If a value for a given symbol cannot be found once the empty environment is arrived at, then an error is thrown. 





Scoping Rules - R Scoping Rules 

Lexical Scoping
What does all this matter?
-Typically, a function is defined in the global environment, so that the values of free variables are just found in the user's workspace
-This behavior is logical for most people and is usually the "right thing" to do
-However, in R you can have functions defined inside other functions
   -Languages like C don't let you do this 
-Now things get interesting - In this case the environment in which a function is defined is the body of another function! 

Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping
-With lexical scoping the value of y in the function g is looked up in the environment in which the function was defined, in this case the global environment, so the value of y is 10.
-With dynamic scoping, the value of y is looked up in the environment from which the function was called (sometimes referred to as the calling environment) 
    -In R the calling environment is known as the parent frame 
-So the value of y would be 2 
When a function is defined in the global environment and is subsequently called from the global environment, then the defining environment and the calling environment are the same. This can sometimes give the appearance of dynamic scoping. 

Other languages 
Other languages that support lexical scoping
-Scheme 
-Perl
-Python
-Common Lisp (all languages converge to Lisp) 

Consequences of Lexical Scoping 
-In R, all objects must be stored in memory
-All functions must carry a pointer to their respective defining environments, which could be anywhere
-In S-PLUS, free variables are always looked up in the global workspace, so everything can be stored on the desk because the "defining environment" of all functions is the same  






Scoping Rules - Optimization Example (OPTIONAL)

Application: Optimization 
Why is any of this information useful?
-Optimization routines in R like optim, nlm, and optimize require yo to pass a function whose argument is a vector of parameters (e.g. a log-likelihood)
-However, an object function might depend on a host of other things besides its parameters (like data) 
-When writing software which does optimization, it may be desirable to allow the user to hold certain parameters fixed

Maximizing a Normal Likelihood
Note: Optimization functions in R minimize functions, so you need to use the negative log-likelihood.

Lexical Scoping Summary
-Objective functions can be "built" which contain all of the necessary data for evaluating the function
-No need to carry around long argument lists - useful for interactive and exploratory work
-Code can be simplified and cleaned up





Coding Standards

Coding Standards for R
1. Always use text files/ text editor
2. Indent your code
3. Limit the width of your code (80 columns?)
4. Limit the length of individual functions

Indenting
-Indenting improves readability
-Fixing line length (80 columns) prevents lots of nesting and very long functions
-Suggested: Indents of 4 spaces at minimum; 8 spaces ideal 






Dates and Times

Dates and Times in R
R has developed a special representation of dates and times 
-Dates are represented by the Date class
-Times are represented by the POSIXct or the POSXit class
-Dates are stored internally as the number of days since 1970-01-01
-Times are stored internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01

Dates in R 
Dates are represented by the Date class and can be coerced from a character string using the as.Date() function.

Times in R
Times are represented using the POSIXct or the POSXlt class
-POSIXct is just a very large integer under the hood; it use a useful class when you want to store times in something like a data frame
-POSIXlt is a list underneath and it stores a bunch of the other useful information like the day of the week, day of the year, month, day of the month
There are a number of generic functions that work on dates and times
-weekdays: give the day of the work
-months: give the month name 
-quarters: give the quarter number ("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", or "Q4")
Times can be coerced from a character string using the as.POSIXlt or as.POSIXct function.
Finally, there is the strptime function in case your dates are written in a different format
I can never remember the formatting strings. Check ?strptime for details.

Operations on Dates and Times 
You can use mathematical operations on dates and times. Well, really just + and -. You can do comparisons too (i.e. ==, <=)
Even keeps tracks of leap years, leap seconds, daylight savings, and time zones. 

Summary
-Dates and times have special classes in R that allow for numerical and statistical calculations
-Dates use the Date class
-Times use the POSIXct and POSIXlt class
-Character strings can be coerced to Date/Time classes using the strptime function or the as.Date, as.POSIXlt, or as.POSIXct
