## ✍️ Reflection  
This module helped me bridge data science and simulation logic. I practiced generating and visualizing statistical randomness, then shifted into evaluating code performance using profiling tools. By the end, I had built full workflows to simulate outcomes and evaluate hospital data — showing how simulation connects to real-world insights.
