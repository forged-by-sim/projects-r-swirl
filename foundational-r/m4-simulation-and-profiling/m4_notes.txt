str function

str: Compactly display the internal structure of an R object

A diagnostic function and an alternative to 'summary'
It is especially well suited to compactly display the (abbreviated) contents pf (possibly nested) lists.
Roughly one line per basic object

What's in this object?

Generating Random Numbers 

Functions for probability distributions in R
rnorm: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation
dnorm: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of points) 
pnorm: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution 
rpois: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate

Probability distribution functions usually have four functions associated with them. The functions are prefixed with a
d for density
r for random number generation
p for cumulative distribution 
q for quantile function 

Setting the random number seed with set.seed ensures reproducibility
Always set the random number seed when conducting a simulation!

Simulation - Random Sampling

Random Sampling
The sample function draws randomly from a specified set of (scalar) objects allowing you to sample from arbitrary distributions. 

Summary
Drawing samples from specific probability can be done with r* functions 
Standard distributions are built in: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Exponential, Gamma, etc.
The sample function can be used to draw random samples from arbitrary vectors
Setting the random number generator seed via set.seed is critical for reproducibility 






R Profiler (Part 1) 

Why is My Code So Slow?
Profiling is a systematic way to examine how much time is spend in different parts of a program
Useful when trying to optimize our code
Often code runs fine once, but what if you have to put it in a loop for 1,000 iterations? Is it still fast enough? 
Profiling is better than guessing

On Optimizing Your Code 
Getting biggest impact on speeding up code depends on knowing where the code spends most of its time 
This cannot be done without performance analysis or profiling 
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil - Donald Knuth 

General Principles of Optimization
Design first, then optimize 
Remember: Premature optimization is the root of all evil
Measure (collect data), don't guess.
If you're going to be a scientist, you need to apply the same principles here! 

Using system.time()
Takes an arbitrary R expression as input (can be wrapped in curly braces) and returns the amount of time taken to evaluate the expression
Computes the time (in seconds) needed to execute an expression 
   -If there's an error, gives time until the error occurred
Returns an object of class proc_time 
   -user time: time charged to CPU(s) for this expression 
   -elapsed time: "wall clock" time
Usually, the user time and elapsed time are relatively close, for straight computing tasks
Elapsed time may be greater than user time if the CPU spends a lot of time waiting around 
Elapsed time may be smaller than the user time if your machine has multiple cores/processors (and is capable of using them) 
   -Multi-threaded BLAS libraries (vecLib/Accelerate, ATLAS, ACML, MKL)
   -Parallel processing via the parallel package 

Beyond system.time()
Using system.time() allows you to test certain functions or code blocks to see if they are taking excessive amounts of time 
Assumes you already know where the problem is and can call system.time() on it
What if you don't know where to start? 





R Profiler (Part 2) 

R Profiler 
The Rprof() function starts the profiler in R
   -R must be compiled with support (but this is usually the case) 
The summaryRprof() function summarizes the output from Rprof() (otherwise it's not readable) 
DO NOT use system.time() and Rprof() together or you will be sad 
Rprof() keeps track of the function call stack at regularly sampled intervals and tabulates how much time is spend in each function
Default sampling interval is 0.02 seconds 
NOTE: If your code runs very quickly, the profiler is not useful, but then you probably don't need it in that case

Using summaryRprof()
The summaryRprof() function tabulates the R profiler output and calculates how much time is spend in which function 
There are two methods for normalizing the data
"by.total" divides the time spend in each function by the total run time 
"by.self" does the same but first subtracts out the time spent in functions above in the call stack

Summary 
Rprof() runs the profiler for performance pf analysis of R code 
summaryRprof() summarizes the output of Rprof() and gives percent of time spent in each function (with two types of normalization) 
Good to break your code into functions so that the profiler can give useful information about where time is being spent 
C or Fortran code is not profiled
